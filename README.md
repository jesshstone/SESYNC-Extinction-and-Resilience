# SESYNC-Extinction-and-Resilience
Our Pursuit is examining resilience and extinction of Caribbean vertebrates. As part of this larger project, we will be:
1) combining data from pre-existing datasets and databases (e.g., paleoclimate data, radiocarbon dates, vertebrate records), and 
2) comparing Ne or effective population sizes derived from genetics with estimates from demographic models.
